# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Graphics LVGL demo

This code example demonstrates how to render a 2D graphics demo using the Light and Versatile Graphics (LVGL) on the PSOC&trade; Edge MCU with the following supported displays. 

- Waveshare 4.3-inch Raspberry Pi DSI 800x480 pixel display
- Waveshare 7-inch Raspberry Pi DSI LCD C 1024x600 pixel display
- 10.1 inch 1024x600 TFT display (WF101JTYAHMNB0)

The 2D graphics showcase a music player application, which is featured as one of the standard demos on the LVGL page. The LCD is connected through the MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI), and the code is designed to operate in a FreeRTOS environment.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application. The CM55 application implements the logic for this code example.

> **Note:** This application builds for the 4.3-inch display by default. 

   ```
   CONFIG_DISPLAY=W4P3INCH_DISP
   ```

  To build the application for the 7-inch display, set the following macro in *common.mk*:

   ```
   CONFIG_DISPLAY=WS7P0DSI_RPI_DISP
   ```

   OR

   To build the application for the 10.1-inch display, set the following macro in *common.mk*:

   ```
   CONFIG_DISPLAY=WF101JTYAHMNB0_DISP
   ```

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the selected LCD display to the board according to the instructions given in [Display setup](#supported-display-and-electrical-connection-with-kit_pse84_eval) section 

2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

4. In the common makefile - _<application\>/common.mk_, add one of the following set of values in the **variable** `CONFIG_DISPLAY` to enable display and it's corresponding touch driver compilation for the selected display panel. The same information is mentioned in comments in the common makefile

   - **Waveshare 4.3-inch Raspberry-Pi DSI LCD and it's touch panel (FT5406):** `W4P3INCH_DISP` <br> This is enabled by default

   - **Waveshare 7 inch Raspberry Pi DSI LCD (C) Display (DISP_WS7P0DSI_RPI) and it's touch panel (GT911):** `WS7P0DSI_RPI_DISP`

   - **10.1 inch 1024*600 TFT LCD (WF101JTYAHMNB0) and it's touch panel (ILI2511):** `WF101JTYAHMNB0_DISP`

      > **Note:** From the above set, at a time only one display with its touch driver will be enabled in the _common makefile_.

      **Example**:

      To use the Waveshare 7-inch Raspberry Pi DSI LCD (C) display:

      ```
      CONFIG_DISPLAY = WS7P0DSI_RPI_DISP
      ```
      OR

      To use the 10.1 inch WF101JTYAHMNB0 display:

      ```
      CONFIG_DISPLAY = WF101JTYAHMNB0_DISP
      ```

5. Build and program the application

6. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC Edge MCU: Graphics LVGL Demo" is displayed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 4. Terminal output on program startup**

   ![](images/terminal-output.png)

7. Observe that the LCD displays a music player demo application. You can use the touch screen to perform various actions such as playing or pausing a track, changing to the next or previous track, and viewing the playlist

   **Figure 5. LVGL demo**

   ![](images/lvgl-demo.png)

   **Figure 6. LVGL music player**

   ![](images/lvgl-music-player.gif)

8. To display CPU usage on the screen, enable the following macro in lv_conf.h:

      ```
      #define LV_USE_SYSMON 1
      ```

   The on-screen position of the CPU usage indicator is determined by the macro:

      ```
      #define LV_USE_PERF_MONITOR_POS LV_ALIGN_BOTTOM_LEFT
      ```

   **Figure 7. LVGL music player with cpu usage**

   ![](images/cpu_usage_display.png)

9. For testing the code example with the other supported display, repeat the above steps. At **Step 4**, enable the display of your choice and then follow the rest of the steps
